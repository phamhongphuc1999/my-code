## Motivation for Account Abstraction

##### Why is there a need for account abstraction?

-   Key pain points such as private key management, transaction fees, usability barriers, and security vulnerabilities.

##### Account Abstraction Overview

-   Account abstraction allows smart contract logic to manage not only transaction effects but also fee payment and validation processes.
-   Key benefits include:
    -   Support for multisig wallets.
    -   Smart recovery mechanisms (e.g., social recovery wallets).
    -   Flexibility in changing keys without altering wallets.
    -   Enhanced security (e.g., quantum safety).

##### Historical Development & Proposals

-   Multiple approaches to account abstraction have been explored, such as:
    -   EIP-86 (early attempt to introduce account abstraction but wasn't adopted).
    -   EIP-2938 (proposal for "native" in-protocol abstraction, but not yet fully implemented).
    -   ERC-4337 (alternative approach that doesn't require protocol changes, focuses on off-chain mechanisms).

1. Understanding Blockchain Accounts
   1.1 Limitations of Current Blockchain Accounts

Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs): Controlled by private keys, with limited flexibility and security features.
Smart Contract Accounts: More programmable but less commonly used for everyday transactions.
1.2 What is Account Abstraction?

A method that allows smart contracts to manage both transaction handling and account operations, including fee payments and validation. This makes accounts more flexible, secure, and user-friendly. 2. Motivation for Account Abstraction
2.1 Challenges with EOAs

Key Management: Risk of key loss or theft.
High Fees: Unpredictable transaction costs.
Complexity: Non-technical users face difficulty in managing private keys and performing transactions.
Security Risks: No built-in support for multisig or recovery options.
2.2 Why Account Abstraction is Needed

Better User Experience: Easier and more flexible wallet management.
Improved Security: Features like multisig, social recovery, and quantum resistance.
Increased Flexibility: Ability to change keys and define custom fee structures without creating a new wallet.
