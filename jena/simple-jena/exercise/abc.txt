Exercise 2.4 Represent the following sentences 
• Romeo thought that Juliet was dead.
• John believes that Mary wants to marry him.
• The dwarf noticed that somebody had been eating from his plate.
Graphically by means of reified triples.
Write a turtle document.

Exercise 2.5 Decide whether the following propositions can be satisfactorily
modeled in RDFS and, if so, give the corresponding RDF(S) specification.
• Every pizza is a meal.
• Pizzas always have at least two toppings.
• Every pizza from the class PizzaMargarita has a Tomato topping.
• Everything having a topping is a pizza.
• No pizza from the class PizzaMargarita has a topping from the class
Meat.
• “Having a topping” is a containedness relation.

Exercise 3.4 The empty graph does not contain any triples (i.e. it corre-
sponds to the empty set). Give derivations showing that the empty graph
RDFS-entails the following triples:
rdfs:Resource rdf:type rdfs:Class .
rdfs:Class rdf:type rdfs:Class .
rdfs:Literal rdf:type rdfs:Class .
rdf:XMLLiteral rdf:type rdfs:Class .
